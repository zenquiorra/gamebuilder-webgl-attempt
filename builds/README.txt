These are some reference GameBuilder builds.

If you don't have it already, you will need to install the free 7-Zip tool to unzip these archives:
  https://www.7-zip.org/

gamebuilder-ARCHIVE.7z.001
  Archival build (last version published to Steam).
  This build corresponds to the last version released to
  Steam. It has most plugins enabled, for example 2D UI,
  rich JS editor, etc.
  
  To unzip this, right click the 001 file, select the "7-Zip" menu, and choose
  an extraction option.

  Multiplayer is not enabled, but it's easy and free to enable it for your own
  private use: Sign up for Photon (photonengine.com) and follow their
  instructions to get a "PUN App ID". Then create a file called
  "photon-app-id.txt" next to "Game Builder.exe" and paste your App ID in there.
  When you run Game Builder now, you will see all multiplayer menus enabled. You
  can have your friends follow these steps with the same App ID and join each
  others' games.

gamebuilder-OSS.7z
  Reference build for Open Source version.
  This is the build that you get when you check out
  and compile the open-source codebase as-is, without
  enabling any extra plugins.
