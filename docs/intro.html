  <h1>Game Builder: Intro to Scripting (API v2)</h1>

  <p>While it's perfectly possible to make an entire game in Game Builder
  without writing a single line of code, writing code will allow you to
  create much richer and more interactive experiences that wouldn't be
  possible just with built-in objects and cards.</p>

  <p>Anyway, enough about the benefits of code :) If you are reading this,
  it's because you are already interested in writing some code and you
  know that coding is fun, so let's get right to it.</p>

  <h2>Fundamentals</h2>

  <p>Any game in Game Builder is made up of two fundamental things:
  <b>terrain</b> and <b>actors</b>. Terrain means the ground and any
  blocks, ramps, corners, etc, that you have placed with the
  <b>Construct</b> tool. Everything else is an <b>actor</b>. For example,
  in the scene below, can you tell what's terrain and what's an actor?

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/actors_and_terrain.png" /> </div>

  <p>Answer: there are 5 actors in the scene:
  <ul>
    <li>The slime on the left
    <li>The rock
    <li>The tree
    <li>The "Hey there" text box
    <li>The player!
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The ground and the metal platform in the center are terrain.</p>

  <h2>Let's add some code!</h2>

  <p>Let's start simple. Create a new game and put just a slime on
  the ground. Not a very exciting game (yet!), I know, but let's start
  simple.</p>

  <p>You can see that the slime moves around. That's a behavior
  that comes with it by default because wandering around aimlessly
  sounds like something a slime would do, but for our purposes let's
  remove it.</p>

  <p>Select the <b>Logic</b> tool and click on the slime. Then look
  for its <b>Enemy AI</b> panel and remove the <b>Wander Around</b> cards.</p>

  <p>You should now have a slime that's standing still.</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/just_a_slime.png" /> </div>

  <p>Now comes the fun part. Use the <b>Logic</b> tool again on the slime,
  but this time click the <b>Code</b> tab at the top.</p>

  <p>And we get... a Javascript editor!</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/code_window.png" /> </div>

  <p>What you are doing now is you're <b>creating a new card</b> that we
  will later use on the slime (but you could use it on anything else).</p>

  <p>Cards are what give behaviors to actors. Each card corresponds to a
  code module like the one you're seeing right now. Yep, cards are just
  a bunch of Javascript. There is no magic, only code!</p>

  <p>First, rename your new card by clicking on the card title field
  (it's the text field highlighted in red the image above). Name it
  something interesting, say, <b>MY CARD</b>.</p>

  <p>Ok, now delete all the sample code you see in the editor and
  replace it by this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    log("Tick...");
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Now click the <b>Save</b> button above the coding area in order to
  apply your changes.</p>

  <p>What happens now?</p>

  <p>You have just <b>created a card</b>. You have not yet <b>added</b>
  that card to the slime. This is what we will do next.</p>

  <h2>Adding the card to the slime</h2>

  <p>Now go back to the <b>Logic</b> tab (make sure the slime is selected).</p>

  <p>In the <b>Custom</b> panel, click the dotted rectangle to add a new
  card. Then drag your fancy new <b>My Card</b> card from the list
  into the slot:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/card_into_slot.gif" /> </div>

  <p>Don't let your hopes up too much yet, this example isn't going to
  do anything, but it will show you an important feature.</p>

  <p>When you drop the card, your slime is now printing "Tick..." to the console
  every time the <tt>onTick()</tt> function is called.</p>

  <p>Where is this console, you ask? Just <b>press the ~ key</b> to
  view it. On a US keyboard, that's the key at the top-left of the keyboard
  below the ESC key, normally just to the left of the 1 key. You should
  now see a little console appear at the top of the screen, filled
  with "Tick..." messages. Close it by pressing ~ again.</p>

  <p>You now know how to print logs. It may not sound exciting, but
  it will be useful later when you're debugging something and need
  to print stuff out!</p>

  <p>Ok, now let's change that code to do something more interesting
  than printing a log. Ready? Replace it with this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    spin(2);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Now click the <b>Run</b> button above the coding area in order
  to apply your changes to your slime.</p>

  <p>What do you get? Yes, a spinning slime:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/spinning_slime.gif" /> </div>

  <p>How does this happen? We are calling the <tt>spin</tt> API function,
  which spins an actor with the given rotational speed. In this case
  we set it to 2 radians/second. Prefer to use degrees/second? No worries,
  just use the handy <tt>degToRad</tt> function.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    // Spin at 45 degrees/second.
    spin(degToRad(45));
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Ok, enough spinning for now. Let's talk about moving around.
  This slime is going places.</p>

  <h2>Movement</h2>

  <p>Now try replacing the code by this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    moveForward(1);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>What do you get? If your answer was <em>runaway slime</em>, you
  are right! The slime just moves forward infinitely:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/runaway_slime.gif" /> </div>

  <p>The <tt>moveForward</tt> API call moves the actor forward with
  the given speed. In this case we required a speed of 1 meter/second.</p>
  
  <p>So what exactly does <em>forward</em> mean? Well, it's the direction
  the slime is currently looking.</p>

  <p>To be more precise, we need to do a quick intro to coordinate systems
  (also called <em>spaces</em>).</p>

  <h2>Brief intro to spaces</h2>
  
  <p>Briefly stated, a <em>space</em> or a <em>coordinate system</em>
  is a way to interpret a set of <em>(x, y, z),</em> coordinates.
  By convention, the X value means "to the right", Y means "up" and
  Z means "forward". With relation to what? Well, that's exactly
  what we have to always clearly state! If I tell you to "go two
  steps to the right", your immediate question will be "my right or your
  right?" (ok, maybe it would be the second question, just after
  "why are you giving me orders?").</p>

  <p>A <em>space</em> is just a formalization of this. A space is just
  a notion of which way is right/up/forward and with relation to what:

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/slime_lion_space.png" /> </div>

  <p>The names we normally give to these arrows are:
  <ul>
    <li>X axis - red arrow. This points to the <b>right</b>.
    <li>Y axis - green arrow. This points <b>up</b>.
    <li>Z axis - blue arrow. This points <b>forward</b>.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Look at the slime in this scene. The three arrows on it represent
  the slime's actor space. That's what the slime thinks of as "forward" (blue
  arrow), "right" (red arrow) and "up" (green arrow). Same thing with the lion:
  that's the lion's actor space. That's what it thinks of as forward/right/up.
  It's different than the slime's notion. It's a different space.</p>

  <p>The third space or coordinate system in the picture (the one in
  the center) is what we call <b>world space</b>. It's a global coordinate
  system that everyone agrees on. When something is given in
  <b>world coordinates</b> that's the space that it's represented on.
  So if I say "go two steps in the <em>world forward</em> direction",
  everyone in the scene would agree about in which direction to go.
  World space is the same for everyone.</p>

  <p>When we are talking about world space, instead of saying "forward",
  "backward", "right" and "left", we tend to say <b>north</b>, <b>south</b>
  <b>east</b> and <b>west</b> instead, because that makes it more clear
  that we are talking about world space. So if I say "everyone, move
  two steps north", everyone would go in the same direction regardless
  of where they are facing.</p>

  <p class="secondary">Note: if you have used other game engines and graphics
  programs before, you may have noticed that some of them like to think of Z as
  pointing "backward" instead of "forward". We use forward because we think
  it's more intuitive this way.</p>

  <h2>Moving in actor space</h2>

  <p>We already saw <tt>moveForward()</tt> in the last section. Now we
  can be more precise about it: <tt>moveForward()</tt> moves forward
  in <em>actor space</em>, so the actor will go in the direction that it's
  looking at.</p>

  <p>Just like we have <tt>moveForward()</tt>, we also have
  <tt>moveBackward()</tt>, <tt>moveRight()</tt>, <tt>moveLeft()</tt>,
  <tt>moveUp()</tt> and <tt>moveDown()</tt>. Those are all in actor space,
  so relative to where the actor is looking.</p>

  <p>Let's combine <tt>spin()</tt> with <tt>moveForward</tt> now for
  an interesting effect:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  // My script

  export function onTick() {
    spin(1);
    moveForward(1);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>What do you get now? Yes, a slime that runs around in circles:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/slime_circles.gif" /> </div>

  <p>Why does this happen? Think about what happens on every tick:
  the slime turns a little bit, then takes a tiny step forward. The fact
  that it's turning means that "forward" is different every time, so
  the net effect is that it runs around in a circle. Neat, right?</p>

  <h2>Moving in world space</h2>

  <p>All of those move in actor space. Now let's see how we'd move in
  world space. Suppose for example that you wanted to move the slime
  north, no matter where it's facing. In this case you can use
  the <tt>moveGlobal</tt> function, which moves an actor with a world-space
  velocity:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    // Move north.
    moveGlobal(vec3(0,0,1));
  }
  </pre>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/slime_world_z.gif" /> </div>

  <p>Note that the slime is moving towards the world's north direction
  regardless of where it's looking. That's why it moves sideways.</p>

  <h2>Interactions</h2>

  <p>What's a fundamental thing that is missing in the examples we've done so
  far? Hint: it's pretty fundamental in games.</p>

  <p>Answer: player interaction! So far, the player has done nothing but
  watch the slimes move, turn, etc. Let's change that now. For example,
  let's make the slime change color when it collides with something.</p>

  <p>For that, we need to introduce a fundamental
  concept: <b>messages</b>.</p>

  <p>A <b>message</b> is just a packet of information that gets sent
  from the engine to an actor, or from an actor to another actor.
  The message tells the actor that something happened, and gives the
  actor a chance to react to it. The code that reacts to a message
  is called the <b>message handler</b> function.</p>

  <p>You have been using messages already! Guess what: <tt>Tick</tt>
  is a message, so when you write your <tt>onTick</tt> function,
  you are in fact handling the <tt>Tick</tt> message. The tick message
  gets delivered to every actor on every tick.</p>

  <p>Another message that the engine delivers to actors automatically
  is the <tt>Collision</tt> message, which indicates that another
  actor has collided with it. Let's try to write a handler for
  that message and see what happens.</p>

  <p>Go back to your slime and edit <b>My Card</b>. Replace the code with
  this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onCollision() {
    // Make it blue.
    setTint(0, 0, 1);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>We set things up so that when the slime hits another actor, it will
  set its color to blue.</p>

  <p>Try it out. When you bump against the slime, it turns blue.</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/slime_blue.gif" /> </div>

  <p>Great, right?</p>

  <h2>Gate: first try</h2>

  <p>Let's use our new skills to make a gate that opens when you bump into
  it. Place a gate between some terrain blocks like this:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/fence.png" /> </div>

  <p>Now, use the <b>Logic</b> tool on the gate and remove its built-in
  IF-THEN panel, because it will interfere with our example. We just
  want a plain gate!</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/if_then_trash.gif" /> </div>

  <p>Now let's try to naively implement a script that opens the gate
  when you bump into it. Make a new card (or reuse the card you already
  had on the slime) and put it on the gate. Write this code on the
  card:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onCollision() {
    // Open the gate by moving the the left a bit
    moveLeft(1);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>It says "if I collide with something, then move left". Sounds right,
  doesn't it? Well... <em>almost</em>. Look at what happens:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/gate_weird.gif" /> </div>

  <p>As you can see, the gate moves left with a speed of 1 meter/second
  only <em>while</em> the player is colliding with it. If you stop colliding
  with the gate, it stops.</p>

  <p>This happens because the <tt>onCollision</tt> message gets delivered
  every frame only while the gate is colliding. After it stops colliding,
  it is no longer delivered, so your <tt>moveLeft</tt> call doesn't execute,
  hence the gate stops moving.</p>

  <p>How could we implement a gate that opens smoothly all the way,
  without needing the player to continually bump against it?</p>

  <p>Well, for that, the gate needs to <em>remember</em> that it's
  currently in the "opening" state. For that, we need memory!</p>

  <h2>Memory</h2>

  <p>Memory means a set of values that an actor or a card remembers.
  You can store variables in memory so you can access them later. It also
  gets included in the save file, so whatever values you store
  are persisted if you save the game and load it again.</p>

  <p>There are two levels of memory:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Card memory:</b> This is the memory that's private to your
    card on this actor. It is not shared with other cards, and not shared
    with other actors. This is the recommended place to put most of your
    state, unless you need to share that state between cards.
    <li><b>Actor memory:</b> This is the memory that belongs to the actor
    as a whole, and is <b>shared</b> by all the cards that exist on
    the same actor. This is accessible through the <tt>mem</tt> global.
    Use this sparingly, since what you write here can overwrite what other
    cards have written.
  </ul>

  <p>Let's use <b>card memory</b> to create a smoother gate.
  When the player bumps into
  it, we will store a variable in card memory called <tt>triggered</tt>
  (it could be called anything else, it's just a variable!), and it will
  represent the fact that the gate has been triggered by the user.</p>

  <p>Then, instead of opening the gate only while it's being collided
  against, we will use the <tt>onTick</tt> function to slowly open it if
  the <tt>triggered</tt> variable is set to <tt>true</tt>.</p>

  <p>To access the card's memory, simply use the <tt>card</tt> object:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onTick() {
    if (card.triggered) {
      moveLeft(2);
    }
  }

  export function onCollision() {
    card.triggered = true;
  }
  </pre>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/gate_smooth.gif" /> </div>
  
  <p>Much better, right? What is happening in this code is:</p>

  <p><ol>
    <li><tt>onTick</tt> gets called every frame. But we don't do anything
      because <tt>card.triggered</tt> hasn't been set yet. So the gate
      stays closed.
    <li>The player bumps into the gate.
    <li><tt>onCollision</tt> now gets called on the gate.
    <li>We set <tt>card.triggered</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
    <li><tt>onTick</tt> continues to get called every frame, but now
      that <tt>card.triggered</tt> is set, we call <tt>moveLeft(2)</tt>
      That function moves the actor to its left with a speed of 2 meters/second.
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Resetting the game</h2>

  <p>You may have noticed something weird in the previous example.
  If you reset the game (press <tt>Ctrl+R</tt>), the gate will immediately open
  again as if you had triggered it. Why?
  This happens because memory <b>is not reset</b> automatically.</p>

  <p>To ensure that things return to their initial state, you have to
  implement <tt>onInit</tt> to reset any memory that you use to a known
  initial state.</p>

  <p>So here is our corrected code:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  // onInit is called every time the game is reset:
  export function onInit() {
    card.triggered = false;
  }
 
  export function onTick() {
    if (card.triggered) {
      moveLeft(2);
    }
  }

  export function onCollision() {
    card.triggered = true;
  }
  </pre>

  <p>This ensures that when the game is reset, the variable <tt>triggered</tt>
  starts with the value of <tt>false</tt>.</p>

  <p>There is still something weird... the gate moves infinitely to
  the left! Why? There is no stopping condition. Once <tt>triggered</tt>
  is set to <tt>true</tt>, it's never reset.</p>

  <p>What we want is to reset it after, say, 1 second. To do this, we
  can send ourselves a "delayed message" to remind ourselves to reset it:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export function onInit() {
    card.triggered = false;
  }

  export function onTick() {
    if (card.triggered) {
      moveLeft(2);
    }
  }

  export function onCollision() {
    card.triggered = true;
    // Remind ourselves to stop in 1 second.
    sendToSelfDelayed(1, "StopIt");
  }

  export function onStopIt() {
    card.triggered = false;
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Now the gate stops after 1 second of motion.</p>

  <h2>Properties</h2>

  <p>When you're designing cards, it's a good strategy to make them as
  reusable as possible. Don't over-optimize a card for that one particular
  actor. Say, for instance, you need to make a slime that turns blue for
  5 seconds when the player hits it. If the "blue" and "5 seconds" are
  hard-coded into the card's code, what happens when you need a slime that
  turns red for 4 seconds instead?</p>

  <p>That's what <b>properties</b> are for.</p>

  <p>This card, for example, could declare two properties: the color to
  use, and the duration, and then implement its logic in terms of these
  properties:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export const PROPS = [
    propColor("Color"),
    propNumber("Duration", 3)
  ];

  export function onInit() {
    // Start green.
    setTint(0, 1, 0);
  }

  export function onCollision() {
    // Bump! Change to the requested color.
    setTintColor(props.Color);
    // Remind ourselves to change back to green.
    sendToSelfDelayed(props.Duration, "RestoreColor");
  }

  export function onRestoreColor() {
    setTint(0, 1, 0);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Users of the card (you!) will now be able to assign its properties:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/editing_props.gif" /> </div>

  <p>The more flexible you make your cards, the more you will be
  able to reuse them in different actors and contexts!</p>

  <h2>Sending messages to other actors</h2>

  <p>Now let's do a more complicated example: a button that launches
  a rocketship.</p>

  <p>There are 2 actors in this example: the rocketship and the button.
  Hitting the button will cause it to send a "Launch" message
  to the rocketship. The rocketship, upon receiving that message, will
  start to go up slowly.</p>

  <p>So let's build the scene first:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/rocket.png" /> </div>

  <p>Nothing fancy. Ok, now let's start with the code for the ship:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  // Ship script
  export function onTick() {
    // If rocket was launched, move up at 2 units/second.
    if (card.launched) {
      moveUp(2);
    }
  }

  // This gets called when we receive the "Launch" message
  // (sent by the button).
  export function onLaunch() {
    card.launched = true;
  }

  export function onInit() {
    card.launched = false;
  }
  </pre>

  <p>Notice how the rocket is programmed to just sit there doing nothing
  until the <tt>card.launched</tt> variable is set to <tt>true</tt>,
  at which point on every tick it will call <tt>moveY</tt> to move up
  at 2 units/second.</p>

  <p>When the rocket receives the <tt>Launch</tt> message (which the button
  will send, as we will show next), then it sets the <tt>card.launched</tt>
  variable to <tt>true</tt>, causing the motion to begin.</p>

  <p>So here is what we write for the button:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  // Declare the "rocket" property of this script, of type Actor:
  export const PROPS = [
    propActor("rocket")
  ];

  // This gets called when the player collides with the button.
  export function onCollision() {
    // Tell rocket to launch.
    send(props.rocket, "Launch");
  }
  </pre>

  <p>There is a funny bit we haven't seen before. This thing:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  export const PROPS = [
    propActor("rocket")
  ];
  </pre>

  <p>This indicates that this script has an <b>actor property</b>
  that can be set. This is similar to other properties we saw before
  (<tt>propNumber</tt> and <tt>propColor</tt>), but the value of this
  property is a <b>reference to another actor</b>.</p>
  
  <p>To assign it, go to the card on the button, and click on the field.
  You can then select the rocket to set the value of that field, and
  from that point on you can refer to the rocket from your card
  as <tt>props.rocket</tt>.</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/set_prop_actor.gif" /> </div>

  <p>This is used in <tt>onCollision</tt>, in which we use the <tt>send</tt>
  function to send a message to the rocket. The message is simply
  <tt>Launch</tt>, which causes the rocket's <tt>onLaunch</tt> function
  to be called, which itself causes the rocket to start going up.

  <p>Here is the result:</p>

  <div class="img_display"> <img src="images/rocket_launch.gif" /> </div>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>

  <p>Now that you know the fundamental of how scripting works,
  you can take a look at the <a href='index.html'>API reference</a>
  for a full list of functions supported by the API. Happy coding!</p>
