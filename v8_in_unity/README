'v8_in_unity' is the Unity native plugin that allows our Unity code (such as
VoosEngine) to use V8, Chromium's JavaScript engine. It provides functions for
compiling scripts at run time, interacting between JS and the actor model, etc.

If you need to modify it, you will need to first build the V8 static libraries.
The last build of the DLL was based on V8 commit:
d2e0166ded485df126c765b9196f7edd1ce50f82.
Make sure you build for x64, non-debug.

Then, you can use Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 to open v8_in_unity.sln to
rebuild the DLLs (for OSX, use the projects in xcode_projects).

In addition to the DLL/bundle projects, there is also a quick test project
'v8_in_unity_test'. This should run and display "All XX checks passed :)" to
indicate success. Make sure this works before trying to use your DLL in Unity.
